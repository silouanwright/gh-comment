I need you to perform a comprehensive security audit of this pull request. Please analyze the code changes systematically using the following framework:

## Security Analysis Framework

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   ðŸ”§ Check for proper authentication mechanisms
   ðŸ”§ Verify authorization controls and role-based access
   ðŸ”§ Look for JWT token handling, session management issues

2. **Input Validation & Sanitization**  
   ðŸ”§ Identify unvalidated user inputs (forms, APIs, query params)
   ðŸ”§ Check for SQL injection, XSS, command injection vulnerabilities
   ðŸ”§ Verify proper data type validation and range checking

3. **Data Protection**
   ðŸ”§ Look for hardcoded secrets, API keys, passwords
   ðŸ”§ Check encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit
   ðŸ”§ Verify secure random number generation

4. **API Security**
   ðŸ”§ Check for proper rate limiting and DoS protection
   ðŸ”§ Verify CORS configuration
   ðŸ”§ Look for information disclosure in error messages

5. **Infrastructure Security**
   ðŸ”§ Review Docker configurations, environment variables
   ðŸ”§ Check for secure defaults in configuration files
   ðŸ”§ Verify dependency security (package.json, requirements.txt, etc.)

For each issue found, please:
- Use ðŸ”§ emoji for critical security issues that must be fixed
- Provide specific line-by-line comments with [SUGGEST: secure_code] alternatives
- Explain the potential impact and attack vectors
- Reference OWASP guidelines where applicable

Please be thorough but practical - focus on issues that could realistically be exploited.
