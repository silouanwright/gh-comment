Please conduct a comprehensive performance review of this pull request, focusing on identifying optimization opportunities and potential bottlenecks.

## Performance Analysis Areas

1. **Database Performance**
   ðŸ¤” Look for N+1 query problems, missing indexes, inefficient queries
   ðŸ¤” Check for proper connection pooling and query optimization
   ðŸ¤” Identify opportunities for caching, batch operations

2. **Memory Management** 
   ðŸ¤” Check for memory leaks, excessive object creation
   ðŸ¤” Look for inefficient data structures, large object retention
   ðŸ¤” Verify proper cleanup of resources, event listeners

3. **Computational Efficiency**
   ðŸ¤” Identify expensive operations in hot paths, loops
   ðŸ¤” Look for redundant calculations, unnecessary processing
   ðŸ¤” Check for proper algorithm complexity (O(n) vs O(nÂ²))

4. **Network & I/O Optimization**
   ðŸ¤” Review API call patterns, bundling opportunities  
   ðŸ¤” Check for proper async/await usage, parallel processing
   ðŸ¤” Look for image optimization, asset compression

5. **Frontend Performance**
   ðŸ¤” Check for unnecessary re-renders, large bundle sizes
   ðŸ¤” Look for lazy loading opportunities, code splitting
   ðŸ¤” Verify proper caching strategies

For each optimization opportunity:
- Use ðŸ¤” emoji for performance suggestions (not blocking)
- Provide [SUGGEST: optimized_code] with more efficient alternatives
- Quantify potential impact where possible (e.g., "reduces database calls by 80%")
- Consider trade-offs between performance and code readability

Focus on changes that will have measurable impact on user experience.
