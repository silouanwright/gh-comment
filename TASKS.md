- [ ] **Real GitHub Integration Tests** - End-to-end workflow testing with actual GitHub PRs
  - **Context**: Current testing uses mocks, but we need to verify the extension works with real GitHub APIs
  - **Strategy**: Create integration tests that open actual PRs, perform command workflows, verify results, then cleanup
  - **Two Test Types**: Automated (full cycle with cleanup) and Manual Verification (leave open for inspection)
  - **Conditional Execution**: Run periodically (e.g., every 10th execution) to avoid API rate limits
  
  **Phase 1: Basic Integration Test Framework**
  - [ ] Create integration test repository or use existing test repo
  - [ ] Design test PR template (simple file changes for testing)
  - [ ] Create script to programmatically open test PRs via GitHub API
  - [ ] Implement basic test runner that can conditionally execute integration tests
  - [ ] Add cleanup mechanism to close/delete test PRs after completion

  **Phase 2: Automated Full-Cycle Tests**
  - [ ] **Test Scenario 1: Comment Workflow**
    - Open PR → Verify no comments (`gh comment list`) → Add line comment (`gh comment add`) → Verify comment exists → Close PR
  - [ ] **Test Scenario 2: Review Workflow** 
    - Open PR → Add review comments (`gh comment add-review`) → Submit review (`gh comment submit-review`) → Verify review exists → Close PR
  - [ ] **Test Scenario 3: Reaction Workflow**
    - Open PR with existing comment → Add reaction (`gh comment reply --reaction`) → Verify reaction → Remove reaction → Close PR
  - [ ] **Test Scenario 4: Reply Workflow**
    - Open PR with existing comment → Reply to comment (`gh comment reply`) → Verify reply chain → Close PR
  - [ ] **Test Scenario 5: Full Interaction Chain**
    - Open PR → Add review comment → Add reaction → Reply to comment → List all (`gh comment list`) → Verify all interactions → Close PR

  **Phase 3: Manual Verification Tests**
  - [ ] **Test Scenario 1: Visual Inspection Workflow**
    - Open PR → Perform various commands → Leave PR open for human verification → Document expected vs actual results
  - [ ] **Test Scenario 2: Suggestion Syntax Testing**
    - Open PR → Test `[SUGGEST: code]` expansion → Test `<<<SUGGEST>>>` syntax → Leave open for verification
  - [ ] **Test Scenario 3: Edge Case Testing**
    - Test multi-line comments, special characters, long messages, etc. → Leave open for verification

  **Phase 4: Advanced Integration Features**
  - [ ] Implement programmatic PR creation with realistic code changes
  - [ ] Add support for testing against different repository types (public/private)

## ✅ **RESOLVED: CI PIPELINE FAILURES**

**✅ Current Status**: Integration test failures that were blocking development have been resolved.

**🎯 Root Cause Addressed**: The integration tests were failing due to PR auto-detection and argument parsing bugs in review/add commands, not CI configuration issues.

**✅ Fixes Applied**:
1. **Fixed integration test failures** - Enhanced parsing logic and validation timing
2. **All integration tests now pass** - Verified with real GitHub API testing  
3. **Development unblocked** - No more blocking test failures

**Remaining CI Improvements (Lower Priority)**:

### 1. **Optional: Optimize CI Integration Test Strategy** 
- [ ] **Consider**: Move `go test -tags=integration` to manual-only workflow 
- [ ] **Location**: `.github/workflows/test.yml` lines 96-97
- [ ] **Benefit**: Avoid unnecessary real GitHub API calls in CI
- [ ] **Status**: Not urgent since integration tests now pass reliably

```yaml
# TODO: Comment out or remove this section from .github/workflows/test.yml
# integration:
#   name: Integration Tests  
#   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
#   needs: [lint, test]
#   steps:
#     - name: Run integration tests
#       run: go test -v -tags=integration ./...  # <-- This calls real GitHub APIs!
```

### 2. **Optional: Fix golangci-lint Configuration**
- [ ] **Issue**: Lint may fail due to deprecated config options (not currently blocking)
- [ ] **Location**: `.golangci.yml` lines 7 and 10
- [ ] **Fix**: Remove deprecated `check-shadowing` and `maligned` settings if they cause issues
- [ ] **Priority**: Low - only address if linting actually fails

### 3. **Optional: Fix Benchmark PR Commenting Permissions**
- [ ] **Issue**: Benchmark step may fail with "Resource not accessible by integration"
- [ ] **Location**: `.github/workflows/test.yml` lines 172-187
- [ ] **Fix**: Add proper permissions or make commenting optional if issues arise
- [ ] **Priority**: Low - only address if benchmarking actually fails

### 4. **Enhancement: Create Separate Integration Test Workflow**
- [ ] **Create** `.github/workflows/integration.yml` for manual integration testing
- [ ] **Trigger**: Manual dispatch only (`workflow_dispatch`)
- [ ] **Environment**: Separate environment with proper secrets and permissions
- [ ] **Priority**: Medium - Nice to have for organized testing

### 5. **Enhancement: Update Integration Test Documentation** 
- [ ] **Update** `docs/testing/INTEGRATION_TESTING.md` 
- [ ] **Add**: Best practices from recent successful integration testing
- [ ] **Document**: How to test functionality changes like we just did
- [ ] **Priority**: Medium - Helps future development

## 🚀 **HIGH PRIORITY CODE IMPROVEMENTS**

### 1. **Standardize Input Parsing Patterns** - ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create unified `parsePositiveInt()` helper function ✅
- [x] Replace scattered `strconv.Atoi()` calls with standardized validation ✅
- [x] Add consistent error messages for invalid inputs ✅
- **Implementation**: Added parsePositiveInt() to cmd/helpers.go with comprehensive validation
- **Coverage**: Updated all comment ID and PR number parsing across commands (add, edit, react, resolve, review-reply, list)
- **Validation**: Rejects zero and negative values with clear error messages
- **Testing**: Added comprehensive test suite with 7 test cases covering all scenarios
```go
// TODO: Add to cmd/helpers.go
func parsePositiveInt(s, fieldName string) (int, error) {
    val, err := strconv.Atoi(s)
    if err != nil || val <= 0 {
        return 0, formatValidationError(fieldName, s, "must be positive integer")
    }
    return val, nil
}
```

### 2. **Push Test Coverage to 85%+** - 🚧 IN PROGRESS (Current: 77.0%)
- [x] Generate HTML coverage report: `go test ./cmd -coverprofile=coverage.out && go tool cover -html=coverage.out` ✅
- [x] Identify uncovered code paths ✅
- [x] Add comprehensive tests for parsePositiveInt helper function ✅
- [x] Add edge case tests for add command (TestAddCommandEdgeCases) ✅
- [ ] Continue adding tests for error conditions in low-coverage functions
- [ ] Test edge cases in suggestion parsing logic  
- [ ] Add boundary condition tests for YAML batch processing
- **Progress**: Coverage improved from 73.3% → 77.0% (+3.7 percentage points)
- **Recent additions**: 7 parsePositiveInt tests + 5 add command edge case tests
- **Next targets**: Functions with <80% coverage (runAdd: 64.1%, getPRContext: 55.6%, processAsReview: 62.1%)

### 3. **Add Input Length Validation**
- [ ] Define constants for GitHub API limits
- [ ] Add comment body length validation (GitHub max: 65,536 chars)
- [ ] Add file path validation to prevent directory traversal
```go
// TODO: Add to cmd/helpers.go
const (
    MaxCommentLength = 65536 // GitHub's actual limit
    MaxFilePathLength = 4096 // Reasonable file path limit
)

func validateCommentBody(body string) error {
    if len(body) > MaxCommentLength {
        return fmt.Errorf("comment too long: %d chars (max %d)", len(body), MaxCommentLength)
    }
    return nil
}
```

## 🎯 **MEDIUM PRIORITY CODE IMPROVEMENTS**

### 4. **Eliminate Magic Numbers**
- [ ] Extract hardcoded values to constants
- [ ] Create `constants.go` file for shared values
- [ ] Update display truncation logic
```go
// TODO: Add to cmd/constants.go
const (
    MaxDisplayBodyLength = 200
    TruncationSuffix = "..."
    TruncationReserve = len(TruncationSuffix)
    MaxGraphQLResults = 100
    DefaultPageSize = 30
)
```

### 5. **Standardize Help Text Format**
- [ ] Review all command help text for consistency
- [ ] Standardize flag description format: `(option1|option2|option3)`
- [ ] Ensure all examples use realistic scenarios
- [ ] Check flag default value display consistency

### 6. **Add More Comprehensive Error Context**
- [ ] Enhance API error messages with suggested actions
- [ ] Add help hints for common error scenarios
- [ ] Include relevant documentation links in error messages
```go
// TODO: Enhance error messages
func formatAPIErrorWithHint(operation string, err error) error {
    hint := getHintForOperation(operation)
    return fmt.Errorf("GitHub API error during %s: %w\n💡 Hint: %s", operation, err, hint)
}
```
