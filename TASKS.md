# Tasks & Development Progress

This file tracks ongoing development tasks, features, and improvements for `gh-comment`. Tasks are organized by priority and status.

## 🚧 In Progress

### High Priority

- [ ] **Real GitHub Integration Tests** - End-to-end workflow testing with actual GitHub PRs
  - **Context**: Current testing uses mocks, but we need to verify the extension works with real GitHub APIs
  - **Strategy**: Create integration tests that open actual PRs, perform command workflows, verify results, then cleanup
  - **Two Test Types**: Automated (full cycle with cleanup) and Manual Verification (leave open for inspection)
  - **Conditional Execution**: Run periodically (e.g., every 10th execution) to avoid API rate limits
  
  **Phase 1: Basic Integration Test Framework**
  - [ ] Create integration test repository or use existing test repo
  - [ ] Design test PR template (simple file changes for testing)
  - [ ] Create script to programmatically open test PRs via GitHub API
  - [ ] Implement basic test runner that can conditionally execute integration tests
  - [ ] Add cleanup mechanism to close/delete test PRs after completion

  **Phase 2: Automated Full-Cycle Tests**
  - [ ] **Test Scenario 1: Comment Workflow**
    - Open PR → Verify no comments (`gh comment list`) → Add line comment (`gh comment add`) → Verify comment exists → Close PR
  - [ ] **Test Scenario 2: Review Workflow** 
    - Open PR → Add review comments (`gh comment add-review`) → Submit review (`gh comment submit-review`) → Verify review exists → Close PR
  - [ ] **Test Scenario 3: Reaction Workflow**
    - Open PR with existing comment → Add reaction (`gh comment reply --reaction`) → Verify reaction → Remove reaction → Close PR
  - [ ] **Test Scenario 4: Reply Workflow**
    - Open PR with existing comment → Reply to comment (`gh comment reply`) → Verify reply chain → Close PR
  - [ ] **Test Scenario 5: Full Interaction Chain**
    - Open PR → Add review comment → Add reaction → Reply to comment → List all (`gh comment list`) → Verify all interactions → Close PR

  **Phase 3: Manual Verification Tests**
  - [ ] **Test Scenario 1: Visual Inspection Workflow**
    - Open PR → Perform various commands → Leave PR open for human verification → Document expected vs actual results
  - [ ] **Test Scenario 2: Suggestion Syntax Testing**
    - Open PR → Test `[SUGGEST: code]` expansion → Test `<<<SUGGEST>>>` syntax → Leave open for verification
  - [ ] **Test Scenario 3: Edge Case Testing**
    - Test multi-line comments, special characters, long messages, etc. → Leave open for verification

  **Phase 4: Advanced Integration Features**
  - [ ] Implement programmatic PR creation with realistic code changes
  - [ ] Add support for testing against different repository types (public/private)
  - [ ] Create test data generator for realistic comment scenarios
  - [ ] Add integration test reporting and result comparison
  - [ ] Implement test result persistence for regression detection

  **Phase 5: Conditional Execution & CI Integration**
  - [ ] Implement "every Nth run" logic for integration tests
  - [ ] Add environment variable controls for integration test execution
  - [ ] Create separate integration test command (`gh comment test-integration`)
  - [ ] Add integration test results to CI/CD pipeline (optional/manual trigger)
  - [ ] Create integration test dashboard for tracking results over time

  **Technical Requirements**
  - Must work with real GitHub API (not mocks)
