  - **Status**: Enhanced help text across multiple commands
  - **Improvements**: Added clear comment type explanations to root, list, add, reply commands
  - **Documentation**: Updated examples to demonstrate proper usage patterns
  - **Clarity**: Users now understand issue comments (general discussion) vs review comments (line-specific)

- [x] **Improve error messages to be actionable instead of raw HTTP codes** - COMPLETED ✅
  - **Status**: Implemented comprehensive actionable error system
  - **Features**: Created formatActionableError() with pattern matching for all GitHub API errors
  - **Enhancements**: Added emoji indicators and specific suggestions for each error type
  - **Coverage**: 422 validation, 401 auth, 403 permission, 404 not found, 500 server, rate limits, network issues
  - **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage for all error scenarios

- [x] **Change reply command default type from 'review' to 'issue' or auto-detect** - ALREADY COMPLETED ✅
  - **Status**: Task was already complete when checked
  - **Verified**: Reply command already defaults to "issue" type 
  - **Implementation**: Flag definition already sets correct default value
  - **No changes needed**: Current implementation already follows best practices

- [x] **Add explanation of GitHub API review limitations to documentation** - COMPLETED ✅
  - **Status**: GitHub API limitations are already well-documented across multiple locations
  - **README.md**: Contains detailed section on pending review API constraints and workarounds
  - **Command help**: close-pending-review command clearly explains GUI-only limitation
  - **Documentation**: Explains that API can't create pending reviews, only GUI can
  - **Coverage**: Review comment threading limitations and own-PR restrictions documented

- [ ] **Make PR auto-detection consistent across all commands** - Some commands auto-detection PR from current branch, others require explicit PR number. Audit all commands in cmd/ directory and ensure consistent behavior. Should either always auto-detect or clearly document when it's required vs optional.

- [x] **Provide sample YAML files for batch command examples** - COMPLETED ✅
  - **Status**: Complete examples/ directory with working YAML configurations created
  - **Files**: review-config.yaml, security-checklist.yaml, bulk-comments.yaml with README.md
  - **Integration**: Help text references functional example files that users can copy-paste
  - **Documentation**: README.md explains usage patterns and provides command examples
  - **Testing**: All example configurations work with actual batch command

- [ ] **Create separate 'react' command for emoji reactions** - Emoji reactions are conceptually different from text comments/replies. Extract reaction functionality from reply command into dedicated `gh comment react <comment-id> <emoji>` command. This separates text-based communication from emoji reactions, making the interface clearer. Should support both adding and removing reactions.

- [x] **Documentation Audit and Organization** - Clean up and organize all markdown files ✅
  - [x] **Phase 1**: Audited all 26 markdown files, identified overlaps and redundancies
  - [x] **Phase 2**: Consolidated ai-prompts + research into cmd/prompts/, cleaned up duplicates  
  - [x] **Phase 3**: Updated cross-references, removed old directories, fixed broken links
  - **Result**: 26→22 files (-15%), all prompts accessible via `gh comment prompts --list`

- [ ] **Real GitHub Integration Tests** - End-to-end workflow testing with actual GitHub PRs
  - **Context**: Current testing uses mocks, but we need to verify the extension works with real GitHub APIs
  - **Strategy**: Create integration tests that open actual PRs, perform command workflows, verify results, then cleanup
  - **Two Test Types**: Automated (full cycle with cleanup) and Manual Verification (leave open for inspection)
  - **Conditional Execution**: Run periodically (e.g., every 10th execution) to avoid API rate limits
  
  **Phase 1: Basic Integration Test Framework**
  - [ ] Create integration test repository or use existing test repo
  - [ ] Design test PR template (simple file changes for testing)
  - [ ] Create script to programmatically open test PRs via GitHub API
  - [ ] Implement basic test runner that can conditionally execute integration tests
  - [ ] Add cleanup mechanism to close/delete test PRs after completion

  **Phase 2: Automated Full-Cycle Tests**
  - [ ] **Test Scenario 1: Comment Workflow**
    - Open PR → Verify no comments (`gh comment list`) → Add line comment (`gh comment add`) → Verify comment exists → Close PR
  - [ ] **Test Scenario 2: Review Workflow** 
    - Open PR → Add review comments (`gh comment add-review`) → Submit review (`gh comment submit-review`) → Verify review exists → Close PR
  - [ ] **Test Scenario 3: Reaction Workflow**
    - Open PR with existing comment → Add reaction (`gh comment reply --reaction`) → Verify reaction → Remove reaction → Close PR
  - [ ] **Test Scenario 4: Reply Workflow**
    - Open PR with existing comment → Reply to comment (`gh comment reply`) → Verify reply chain → Close PR
  - [ ] **Test Scenario 5: Full Interaction Chain**
    - Open PR → Add review comment → Add reaction → Reply to comment → List all (`gh comment list`) → Verify all interactions → Close PR

  **Phase 3: Manual Verification Tests**
  - [ ] **Test Scenario 1: Visual Inspection Workflow**
    - Open PR → Perform various commands → Leave PR open for human verification → Document expected vs actual results
  - [ ] **Test Scenario 2: Suggestion Syntax Testing**
    - Open PR → Test `[SUGGEST: code]` expansion → Test `<<<SUGGEST>>>` syntax → Leave open for verification
  - [ ] **Test Scenario 3: Edge Case Testing**
    - Test multi-line comments, special characters, long messages, etc. → Leave open for verification

  **Phase 4: Advanced Integration Features**
  - [ ] Implement programmatic PR creation with realistic code changes
  - [ ] Add support for testing against different repository types (public/private)
  - [ ] Create test data generator for realistic comment scenarios
  - [ ] Add integration test reporting and result comparison
  - [ ] Implement test result persistence for regression detection

- ✅ **Security Compliant**: Secure design with proper input validation
- ✅ **Well Documented**: Industry-leading help text and examples
- 🔧 **Polish Opportunities**: Minor improvements for A+ grade

---

## ✅ **RESOLVED: CI PIPELINE FAILURES**

**✅ Current Status**: Integration test failures that were blocking development have been resolved.

**🎯 Root Cause Addressed**: The integration tests were failing due to PR auto-detection and argument parsing bugs in review/add commands, not CI configuration issues.

**✅ Fixes Applied**:
1. **Fixed integration test failures** - Enhanced parsing logic and validation timing
2. **All integration tests now pass** - Verified with real GitHub API testing  
3. **Development unblocked** - No more blocking test failures

**Remaining CI Improvements (Lower Priority)**:

### 1. **Optional: Optimize CI Integration Test Strategy** 
- [ ] **Consider**: Move `go test -tags=integration` to manual-only workflow 
- [ ] **Location**: `.github/workflows/test.yml` lines 96-97
- [ ] **Benefit**: Avoid unnecessary real GitHub API calls in CI
- [ ] **Status**: Not urgent since integration tests now pass reliably

```yaml
# TODO: Comment out or remove this section from .github/workflows/test.yml
# integration:
#   name: Integration Tests  
#   runs-on: ubuntu-latest
#   needs: [lint, test]
#   steps:
#     - name: Run integration tests
#       run: go test -v -tags=integration ./...  # <-- This calls real GitHub APIs!
```

### 2. **Optional: Fix golangci-lint Configuration**
- [ ] **Issue**: Lint may fail due to deprecated config options (not currently blocking)
- [ ] **Location**: `.golangci.yml` lines 7 and 10
- [ ] **Fix**: Remove deprecated `check-shadowing` and `maligned` settings if they cause issues
- [ ] **Priority**: Low - only address if linting actually fails

### 3. **Optional: Fix Benchmark PR Commenting Permissions**
- [ ] **Issue**: Benchmark step may fail with "Resource not accessible by integration"
- [ ] **Location**: `.github/workflows/test.yml` lines 172-187
- [ ] **Fix**: Add proper permissions or make commenting optional if issues arise
- [ ] **Priority**: Low - only address if benchmarking actually fails

### 4. **Enhancement: Create Separate Integration Test Workflow**
- [ ] **Create** `.github/workflows/integration.yml` for manual integration testing
- [ ] **Trigger**: Manual dispatch only (`workflow_dispatch`)
- [ ] **Environment**: Separate environment with proper secrets and permissions
- [ ] **Priority**: Medium - Nice to have for organized testing

### 5. **Enhancement: Update Integration Test Documentation** 
- [ ] **Update** `docs/testing/INTEGRATION_TESTING.md` 
- [ ] **Add**: Best practices from recent successful integration testing
- [ ] **Document**: How to test functionality changes like we just did
- [ ] **Priority**: Medium - Helps future development

- [ ] Add consistent error messages for invalid inputs
```go
// TODO: Add to cmd/helpers.go
func parsePositiveInt(s, fieldName string) (int, error) {
    val, err := strconv.Atoi(s)
    if err != nil || val <= 0 {
        return 0, formatValidationError(fieldName, s, "must be positive integer")
    }
    return val, nil
}
```

### 2. **Push Test Coverage to 85%+**

- [ ] Identify uncovered code paths
- [ ] Add tests for error conditions in `getCurrentPR()`/`getCurrentRepo()`
- [ ] Test edge cases in suggestion parsing logic
- [ ] Add boundary condition tests for YAML batch processing

### 3. **Add Input Length Validation**
- [ ] Define constants for GitHub API limits
- [ ] Add comment body length validation (GitHub max: 65,536 chars)
- [ ] Add file path validation to prevent directory traversal
```go
// TODO: Add to cmd/helpers.go
const (
    MaxCommentLength = 65536 // GitHub's actual limit
    MaxFilePathLength = 4096 // Reasonable file path limit
)

func validateCommentBody(body string) error {
    if len(body) > MaxCommentLength {
        return fmt.Errorf("comment too long: %d chars (max %d)", len(body), MaxCommentLength)
    }
    return nil
}
```

---

## 🎯 **MEDIUM PRIORITY CODE IMPROVEMENTS**

### 4. **Eliminate Magic Numbers**
- [ ] Extract hardcoded values to constants
- [ ] Create `constants.go` file for shared values
- [ ] Update display truncation logic
```go
// TODO: Add to cmd/constants.go
const (
    MaxDisplayBodyLength = 200
    TruncationSuffix = "..."
    TruncationReserve = len(TruncationSuffix)
    MaxGraphQLResults = 100
    DefaultPageSize = 30
)
```

### 5. **Standardize Help Text Format**
- [ ] Review all command help text for consistency
- [ ] Standardize flag description format: `(option1|option2|option3)`
- [ ] Ensure all examples use realistic scenarios
- [ ] Check flag default value display consistency

### 6. **Add More Comprehensive Error Context**
- [ ] Enhance API error messages with suggested actions
- [ ] Add help hints for common error scenarios
- [ ] Include relevant documentation links in error messages
```go
// TODO: Enhance error messages
func formatAPIErrorWithHint(operation string, err error) error {
    hint := getHintForOperation(operation)
    return fmt.Errorf("GitHub API error during %s: %w\n💡 Hint: %s", operation, err, hint)
}
```
