## 🎯 HIGH PRIORITY

### **Real GitHub Integration Tests** - ✅ COMPLETED - End-to-end workflow testing with actual GitHub PRs
- **Context**: Current testing uses mocks, but we need to verify the extension works with real GitHub APIs
- **Strategy**: Create integration tests that open actual PRs, perform command workflows, verify results, then cleanup
- **Two Test Types**: Automated (full cycle with cleanup) and Manual Verification (leave open for inspection)
- **Conditional Execution**: Run periodically (e.g., every 10th execution) to avoid API rate limits

#### **Phase 1: Basic Integration Test Framework** - ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Create integration test repository or use existing test repo ✅
- [x] Design test PR template (simple file changes for testing) ✅
- [x] Create script to programmatically open test PRs via GitHub API ✅
- [x] Implement basic test runner that can conditionally execute integration tests ✅
- [x] Add cleanup mechanism to close/delete test PRs after completion ✅

#### **Phase 2: Automated Full-Cycle Tests** - ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Test Scenario 1: Comment Workflow** ✅
  - Open PR → Verify no comments (`gh comment list`) → Add line comment (`gh comment add`) → Verify comment exists → Close PR
- [x] **Test Scenario 2: Review Workflow** ✅
  - Open PR → Add review comments (`gh comment add-review`) → Submit review (`gh comment submit-review`) → Verify review exists → Close PR
- [x] **Test Scenario 3: Reaction Workflow** ✅
  - Open PR with existing comment → Add reaction (`gh comment reply --reaction`) → Verify reaction → Remove reaction → Close PR
- [x] **Test Scenario 4: Reply Workflow** ✅
  - Open PR with existing comment → Reply to comment (`gh comment reply`) → Verify reply chain → Close PR
- [x] **Test Scenario 5: Full Interaction Chain** ✅
  - Open PR → Add review comment → Add reaction → Reply to comment → List all (`gh comment list`) → Verify all interactions → Close PR

#### **Phase 3: Manual Verification Tests** - ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Test Scenario 1: Visual Inspection Workflow** ✅
  - Open PR → Perform various commands → Leave PR open for human verification → Document expected vs actual results
- [x] **Test Scenario 2: Suggestion Syntax Testing** ✅
  - Open PR → Test `[SUGGEST: code]` expansion → Test `<<<SUGGEST>>>` syntax → Leave open for verification
- [x] **Test Scenario 3: Edge Case Testing** ✅
  - Test multi-line comments, special characters, long messages, etc. → Leave open for verification

#### **Phase 4: Advanced Integration Features** - ✅ COMPLETED
